TESTING PART B
======================================================================

Tests are available in the prompt/tests/ directory.
Each *.pickle file corresponds to a single test file.

To test your implementation for correctness, please run
    python solution_template.py --c <test_file_name>

If your implementation is correct, a message "TESTS PASSED" will
be printed. In case of an incorrect implementation, "TESTS FAILED"
will be printed


To test your implementation for performance, please run
    python solution_template.py <test_file_name>

For reference, here are the running times of the staff implementation
for the different test files, < Note that this was not carried out in
a standardized testing environment >
    1. test1.pickle: 0.595 seconds
    2. test2.pickle: 0.305 seconds
    3. test3.pickle: 2.8 seconds
    4. test4.pickle: 3.03 seconds
    5. test5.pickle: 29.37 seconds
